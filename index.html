        " Born in Seoul, South Korea in 1999, Hunji Ishome is an artist,
        architect, and fashion designer."
        <br>
        " In present times, Hunji Ishome is studying for a degree in B.Arch
          at the Rhode Island School of Design. Curious about spaces that
          provoke emotion, Ishome was introduced to the sentimently
          orchestrated spaces of Tadao Ando, a 'forerunner' of what is
          widely known today as the modern contemporary brutalist movement. "
          <br>
          " In search of a safe space of his own, Ishome utilyzes the
          delicate absences of textures and oversaturation to curate works
          and spaces in hopes of freeing us all from the burdens of
          an Information Overloaded Age. "
